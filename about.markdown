Hi,

I'm a BSc Geography student (Specialisation Cartography and Geoinformatics) at the University of Vienna. I make scripts, scrapers, little games, web-apps but really anything teaching myself to code.

This blog will document my experiences with OpenScience Communities that I engage with throughout the first half of 2022 as tasked by the Uni course "[Social thinking in Computer Science](https://ufind.univie.ac.at/en/course.html?lv=059021&semester=2022S)".

This blog was created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll) via Github Pages.
